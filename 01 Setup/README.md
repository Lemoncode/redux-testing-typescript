# Sample 00: Start

This is the starting point, this sample is a refactored version of
"11 Spinner Async" that can be found in the [react-typescript-samples
repository](https://github.com/Lemoncode/react-typescript-samples).

# About the sample:

- Is just a master detail like application.
- Users can browse a list of "fake" team members (using a fake api).
- When a given user click on one of the users in the fake member list
it navigates to a detail page (the detail info is loaded from GitHub rest api).
- The detail window includes some basic form validation.
- Save button only validates but the operation is only performed locally
(we are not hitting the real github api just to avoid trolling github).
