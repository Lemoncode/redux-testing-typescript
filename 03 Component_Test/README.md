# Sample 02: Actions


**TODO: add to all samples npm install json-loader react-addons-test-utils --save -dev **

In this sample we take as starting point sample: "02 Action_Test" and we will add all unit tests to components:
- Stateless components.
- Containers.
- Presentationals.

We will use _Enzyme_ as component testing library.

Summary:

- Implement tests for a container componenent.
- Implement test for a presentational component.


# Steps:

Let's start with memberRow stateless component.

Under _components/members_ let's create subfolder called _spec_, and create file
called memberRow.spec.tsx
